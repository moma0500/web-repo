    <h3>What is Lagree?</h3>
      <p>Lagree is a calisthenic workout that is focused on one machine called the megaformer. This machine is in essence, two platforms with a carriage that moves in between the two. Under this carriage there is a set of springs that control the amount of tension between you or the carriage and the platforms. There are two different colors of springs that have different tensions: yellow and red. One red spring is equivalent to 5 yellow springs worth of tension. This workout is usually done in 50 minutes and incorporates 4 different blocks of work: core, obliques, arms, and legs. The aim of this workout is to move as slow as possible to activate slow twitching muscle fibers to achieve long, lean muscles. </p>
